# Real-Time Sign Language Interpreter

![Project Banner](https://your-image-link.com/banner.jpg)

## Overview

This project is a real-time sign language interpreter that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the American Sign Language dataset from Kaggle. The model can be downloaded from this repository and is designed to run on a self-configured Raspberry Pi, forming the basis for a portable and efficient real-time sign language interpreter.

## Features

- Real-time sign language recognition
- Trained on the American Sign Language dataset
- Portable solution using Raspberry Pi
- Easy to set up and use

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi (self-configured)
- Python 3.x
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Download the trained model from this repository

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**


2. **Install the Required Libraries**


3. **Download the Model**

    Download the trained model from this repository and place it in the project directory.

### Running the Interpreter

1. **Load the Model**

    The model can be loaded using the `load_model` function from Keras.

2. **Run the Script**

    Use the provided script to start the real-time sign language interpreter.


### Usage

- Point your camera at your hand to make a sign.
- The interpreter will recognize the sign and display the corresponding letter or word in real-time.

## Dataset

The model was trained using the [American Sign Language Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist) from Kaggle. The dataset includes images of hand signs representing the letters of the American Sign Language alphabet.

## Model

The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using Keras. It has been trained to accurately recognize and interpret American Sign Language signs.

## Configuration on Raspberry Pi

1. **Setup Raspberry Pi**

    Follow the official Raspberry Pi setup guide to configure your Raspberry Pi with the required operating system and dependencies.

2. **Transfer Project Files**

    Transfer the cloned repository and the downloaded model to your Raspberry Pi.

3. **Run the Interpreter**

    Use the same commands mentioned above to install dependencies and run the interpreter script on your Raspberry Pi.
